# Audio Feedback (Howling) Simulation System

## Project Description
This Python program simulates audio feedback (howling) phenomena in acoustic systems. It can:
1. Simulate room acoustics using Room Impulse Response (RIR) generation
2. Model the feedback loop between microphone and speaker systems
3. Generate microphone and speaker signals containing howling effects

## Features
- Realistic room acoustics simulation via RIR generation
- STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) based audio processing
- Outputs both microphone and speaker signals with howling effects

## Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy scipy soundfile rir-generator
```
## TODO
1. Howling Detect
2. Howling Suppression
